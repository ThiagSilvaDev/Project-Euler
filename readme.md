# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to the repository of solutions for Project Euler problems, implemented in Python.

## About

This repository contains implementations for solving various Project Euler problems. Each problem is organized in its own directory with solutions provided in C.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure is organized as follows:

```
problems/
├── 001/
│   ├── pysolution.py
│   └── problem.md
├── 002/
│   ├── pysolution.py
│   └── problem.md
└── ...
```

- `problems/`: Contains directories for each problem.
- `001/`, `002/`, etc.: Directories for specific problems.
- `pysolution.py`: Python solution for the problem.
- `problem.md`: Description of the problem.

### Usage Instructions Compiling and Running Python Solutions

1. Navigate to the problem directory and choose one of the problems:

   ```sh
   cd problems/001
   ```

2. Run the program:

   ```sh
   python3 ./pysolution.py
   ```
